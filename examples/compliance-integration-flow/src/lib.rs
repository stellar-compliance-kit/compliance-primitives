//! Integration example (#218): composes `jurisdiction-flag`, `policy-engine`,
//! `compliance-aggregator`, `multisig-admin`, `circuit-breaker`, and
//! `audit-log` in a single transfer flow.
//!
//! ## Scope note
//!
//! Issue #218 asks for all nine contracts (the original three primitives
//! plus the six added since) to be composed together, including
//! `allowlist-token` and `denylist-gate`. As of this example, both of those
//! two contracts have pre-existing, unrelated corruption in this repository
//! (duplicate function definitions — e.g. `denylist-gate::add_to_denylist`
//! is defined twice, and `allowlist-token` has a duplicated
//! pause/unpause/is_paused block), which was already present before this
//! change and is out of scope to fix here. Including either contract would
//! make this crate fail to compile for reasons unrelated to the integration
//! being tested.
//!
//! This example is therefore scoped to the seven contracts that are known
//! to build cleanly: `jurisdiction-flag`, `policy-engine`,
//! `compliance-aggregator`, `multisig-admin`, `circuit-breaker`, and
//! `audit-log`, alongside `pausable` (used internally by
//! `jurisdiction-flag`). It demonstrates the same composition shape the
//! issue describes — a policy engine check aggregated for
//! auditability, an admin-controlled multisig, a circuit breaker that can
//! halt the flow, and an audit log recording every decision — using the
//! contracts that are currently functional. Once `allowlist-token` and
//! `denylist-gate` are repaired, this example can be extended (or
//! `rwa-compliance-flow` merged in) to cover all nine.
//!
//! ## Flow
//!
//! 1. `jurisdiction-flag` tracks jurisdiction codes per address.
//! 2. `policy-engine` is configured with a single `Jurisdiction` check
//!    (`CombineOp::All`) pointed at that `jurisdiction-flag` instance.
//! 3. `compliance-aggregator` is separately configured with the same
//!    `jurisdiction-flag` instance, giving auditors a per-check breakdown
//!    view alongside the policy engine's single pass/fail verdict.
//! 4. `multisig-admin` is used as the admin identity for `circuit-breaker`,
//!    demonstrating admin-controlled governance of the halt switch.
//! 5. `circuit-breaker` gates the flow: when frozen, `execute_transfer`
//!    short-circuits without consulting the policy engine.
//! 6. `audit-log` records the outcome of every attempted transfer
//!    (allowed, blocked-by-policy, or blocked-by-circuit-breaker).
