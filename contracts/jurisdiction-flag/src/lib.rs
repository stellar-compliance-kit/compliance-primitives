//! `jurisdiction-flag` is a `#![no_std]` Soroban contract that attaches a
//! jurisdiction code (e.g. an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code) to an
//! address.
//!
//! **Purpose**: let an issuer record which jurisdiction(s) an address has
//! been verified in — including dual citizenship/residency — so other
//! contracts can restrict activity to a permitted set of jurisdictions
//! without each one reimplementing that bookkeeping.
//!
//! **Storage shape**: `DataKey::Jurisdiction(Address)` stores a
//! `Vec<String>` of codes. The legacy single-code helpers
//! `set_jurisdiction` / `get_jurisdiction` remain as conveniences:
//! `set_jurisdiction` replaces the address's entire set with a one-element
//! vector, and `get_jurisdiction` returns the first code (if any). Prefer
//! `add_jurisdiction` / `remove_jurisdiction` / `list_jurisdictions` when
//! managing multiple codes. This shape leaves room for #83 (batch remove
//! over the same vec) and #110 (richer per-code metadata) without a second
//! parallel key.
//!
//! **Permission semantics**: `is_permitted_jurisdiction` uses *any*
//! matching — it returns `true` if at least one of the address's codes
//! appears in `allowed_codes`. An address with no codes is never permitted.
//!
//! **Callers**: only the configured `issuer` address may call
//! `set_jurisdiction` / `remove_jurisdiction_multiple`. Any contract or
//! off-chain client can read a flag via `get_jurisdiction`, and contracts
//! enforcing a jurisdiction allowlist can call
//! `is_permitted_jurisdiction(address, allowed_codes)` directly as part of
//! their own compliance checks.
//!
//! **Composition**: designed to be called into from another contract's
//! `transfer` or similar gating logic — the same pattern `denylist-gate`
//! uses — rather than deployed standalone.
//!
//! **Pausability**: the issuer may call `pause` to halt all mutating
//! operations (`set_jurisdiction`). The read-only `get_jurisdiction` and
//! `is_permitted_jurisdiction` methods are unaffected by pause state. The
//! shared [`compliance_pausable`] helper crate implements the pause storage
//! logic; this contract only supplies issuer-gating and event emission.
