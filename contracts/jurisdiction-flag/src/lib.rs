//! `jurisdiction-flag` is a `#![no_std]` Soroban contract that attaches a
//! jurisdiction code (e.g. an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code) to an
//! address.
//!
//! **Purpose**: let an issuer record which jurisdiction an address has been
//! verified in, so other contracts can restrict activity to a permitted set
//! of jurisdictions without each one reimplementing that bookkeeping.
//!
//! **Callers**: only the configured `issuer` address may call
//! `set_jurisdiction`. Any contract or off-chain client can read a flag via
//! `get_jurisdiction`, and contracts enforcing a jurisdiction allowlist can
//! call `is_permitted_jurisdiction(address, allowed_codes)` directly as part
//! of their own compliance checks.
//!
//! **Composition**: designed to be called into from another contract's
//! `transfer` or similar gating logic — the same pattern `denylist-gate`
//! uses — rather than deployed standalone.
