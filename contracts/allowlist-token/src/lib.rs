//! `allowlist-token` is a `#![no_std]` Soroban contract that wraps an existing
//! SEP-41 token and only permits `transfer` calls between two addresses that
//! are both present on an on-chain allowlist.
//!
//! **Purpose**: give issuers of permissioned tokens (e.g. RWA or regulated
//! stablecoins) a drop-in gate that blocks transfers to or from addresses
//! that haven't cleared KYC/onboarding, without modifying the underlying
//! token contract's own logic.
//!
//! **Callers**: an `admin` address manages the allowlist through
//! `add_to_allowlist`/`remove_from_allowlist`. End users — or the wallets
//! and apps acting on their behalf — call `transfer` exactly as they would
//! on a plain SEP-41 token; the allowlist check happens transparently.
//!
//! **Composition**: deploy this contract in front of an issuer's real token
//! and point clients at it instead of the underlying token — cleared
//! transfers are forwarded on via a cross-contract call. This is the one
//! primitive in the workspace meant to be deployed standalone rather than
//! called into by another contract; contrast with `denylist-gate` and
//! `jurisdiction-flag`, which are designed to be composed into a caller's
//! own token contract.
