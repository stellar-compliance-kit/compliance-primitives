# Contributing to compliance-primitives

Thanks for your interest in contributing. This repo is part of the **Drips
Wave Stellar Program**, and issues are labeled by complexity
(`complexity: trivial`, `complexity: medium`, `complexity: high`) so you can
pick something that matches how deep you want to go. Issues good for a first
contribution are also tagged `good first issue`.

For details on how issues are triaged, labeled, and prioritized, see
[GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md).

## Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository and clone your fork.
2. **Branch** off `main` with a descriptive name, e.g. `add-jurisdiction-remove-fn`.
3. **Make your change**, keeping it scoped to the issue you're addressing.
   Each contract crate is meant to stay small, single-responsibility, and
   under ~300 lines — if a change grows a contract past that, consider
   whether it belongs in a new crate or `/examples` instead.
4. **Add tests.** Every public function needs coverage for its happy path
   and at least one failure/auth case. New functionality without tests
   won't be merged.
5. **If you've changed any public function signature or interface-related
   attribute on a contract, regenerate the docs interfaces:**
   ```sh
   ./scripts/regenerate-docs.sh
   ```
   This rebuilds all contracts to wasm and extracts each contract's Soroban
   XDR interface spec into `docs/interfaces/`.  Commit the updated files.
6. **Before submitting a PR, run:**
   ```sh
   make test
   make lint
   ```
   Both must pass locally — the same checks run in CI on every PR.
7. **If your change touches `contracts/multisig-admin` or
   `contracts/circuit-breaker`**, work through
   [`docs/admin-control-review-checklist.md`](./docs/admin-control-review-checklist.md)
   before opening the PR — these two contracts have a larger blast radius
   than the rest of the workspace, and the PR template will ask you to
   confirm you've done this.
8. **Open a pull request** against `main`, referencing the issue it closes
   (e.g. `Closes #12`). Describe what changed and why.

## Complexity labels and expected PR size

The complexity label on an issue is also a signal for how big the resulting
PR should be. Before you start, gut-check your planned change against the
issue's label:

- **`complexity: trivial`** — typically a single file, or a small
  documentation/test addition. No new public API surface. Example: adding an
  issue template, or a single focused unit test like the one requested in
  this same batch (`check()` returns true immediately after
  `remove_from_denylist`).
- **`complexity: medium`** — typically adds one new public function, or a
  new test category, to a single contract. Example: adding a `get_admin()`
  view function to `allowlist-token`, including happy-path and
  not-initialized test coverage.
- **`complexity: high`** — typically involves a design or threat-model
  writeup, changes that span multiple contracts, or new tooling/CI. Example:
  introducing a new cross-contract composition pattern or a new primitive
  crate.

If your planned PR looks a lot bigger (or smaller) than the label suggests,
that's worth flagging in the issue before you start — the label may be
wrong, or the issue may need to be split.

## Picking up an issue

Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it. If you go
quiet for a while, don't worry — someone else may pick it up, and you're
welcome to jump back in on something else.

## Fuzz targets

This repo uses lightweight seeded-PRNG sequence fuzzers inside each
contract's `#[cfg(test)]` tree rather than a separate `cargo-fuzz`
workspace — see [`/fuzz/README.md`](./fuzz/README.md) for the full
rationale and the list of contracts already covered.

**Running the existing fuzz targets locally:**

```sh
# Short run (also covered by `cargo test` / CI), e.g. jurisdiction-flag
cargo test -p jurisdiction-flag fuzz_jurisdiction_set_get_sequences -- --nocapture

# Periodic longer campaign — run after non-trivial changes to the
# fuzzed functions, or as part of a release checklist
FUZZ_ITERATIONS=2000 FUZZ_OPS=64 \
  cargo test -p jurisdiction-flag fuzz_jurisdiction_set_get_sequences -- --nocapture
```

A failing run prints the failing `seed`, so the exact operation sequence
that triggered it is reproducible by re-running with that seed.

**Adding a new fuzz target for a contract:**

1. Add a `fuzz.rs` module to the contract crate (see
   `contracts/jurisdiction-flag/src/fuzz.rs` for the reference shape) and
   wire it in with `#[cfg(test)] mod fuzz;` in `lib.rs`.
2. Write a tiny xorshift-style PRNG (or reuse the pattern from an existing
   `fuzz.rs`) to generate a bounded sequence of random operations against
   the contract's public functions, using `soroban_sdk::testutils` to set
   up the `Env`, `mock_all_auths`, and generated `Address`es.
3. After each generated operation, assert the invariant(s) that must hold
   regardless of the operation sequence (e.g. "last write wins", "a
   read-only check's result is consistent with the underlying state").
4. Read iteration/operation counts from env vars (e.g. `FUZZ_ITERATIONS`,
   `FUZZ_OPS`) with small defaults so the target runs quickly under normal
   `cargo test` / CI, and print the seed on failure so a crash is
   reproducible.
5. Document the new target in [`/fuzz/README.md`](./fuzz/README.md):
   the harness location, the invariants it checks, and the short-run vs.
   longer-campaign commands.

**Interpreting a crash artifact:** since these are plain `#[test]` loops
rather than libFuzzer targets, a failure surfaces as a normal test
failure — there's no binary corpus file to inspect. Each iteration's
`seed` doubles as its loop index (`1..=FUZZ_ITERATIONS`) and is included
in every assertion message (e.g. `seed=57 addr=2: last-write-wins
mismatch`), so the run is already deterministic and reproducible: rerun
with `FUZZ_ITERATIONS` set to at least that seed and add a temporary
`if seed == 57 { std::eprintln!("{:?}", ...); }` (or similar) inside the
loop to print the operation sequence and state at the point of failure.

## Code style

- `#![no_std]` throughout; no `std`-only dependencies in contract crates.
- Public functions should have doc comments explaining behavior, especially
  auth requirements and failure conditions.
- Prefer returning `Result<T, Error>` with a `#[contracterror]` enum over
  panicking, except where `require_auth()`'s own panic behavior is the
  expected failure mode.
- Keep events auditable: if a function's outcome should be visible off-chain
  (e.g. a blocked transfer), don't put it behind a code path that would
  cause the whole invocation to revert — Soroban rolls back events emitted
  during any invocation that ultimately fails.
