# Contributing to compliance-primitives

Thanks for your interest in contributing. This repo is part of the **Drips
Wave Stellar Program**, and issues are labeled by complexity
(`complexity: trivial`, `complexity: medium`, `complexity: high`) so you can
pick something that matches how deep you want to go. Issues good for a first
contribution are also tagged `good first issue`.

For details on how issues are triaged, labeled, and prioritized, see
[GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md).

## Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository and clone your fork.
2. **Branch** off `main` with a descriptive name, e.g. `add-jurisdiction-remove-fn`.
3. **Make your change**, keeping it scoped to the issue you're addressing.
   Each contract crate is meant to stay small, single-responsibility, and
   under ~300 lines — if a change grows a contract past that, consider
   whether it belongs in a new crate or `/examples` instead.
4. **Add tests.** Every public function needs coverage for its happy path
   and at least one failure/auth case. New functionality without tests
   won't be merged.
5. **If you've changed any public function signature or interface-related
   attribute on a contract, regenerate the docs interfaces:**
   ```sh
   ./scripts/regenerate-docs.sh
   ```
   This rebuilds all contracts to wasm and extracts each contract's Soroban
   XDR interface spec into `docs/interfaces/`.  Commit the updated files.
6. **Before submitting a PR, run:**
   ```sh
   make test
   make lint
   ```
   Both must pass locally — the same checks run in CI on every PR.
7. **Open a pull request** against `main`, referencing the issue it closes
   (e.g. `Closes #12`). Describe what changed and why.

## Complexity labels and expected PR size

The complexity label on an issue is also a signal for how big the resulting
PR should be. Before you start, gut-check your planned change against the
issue's label:

- **`complexity: trivial`** — typically a single file, or a small
  documentation/test addition. No new public API surface. Example: adding an
  issue template, or a single focused unit test like the one requested in
  this same batch (`check()` returns true immediately after
  `remove_from_denylist`).
- **`complexity: medium`** — typically adds one new public function, or a
  new test category, to a single contract. Example: adding a `get_admin()`
  view function to `allowlist-token`, including happy-path and
  not-initialized test coverage.
- **`complexity: high`** — typically involves a design or threat-model
  writeup, changes that span multiple contracts, or new tooling/CI. Example:
  introducing a new cross-contract composition pattern or a new primitive
  crate.

If your planned PR looks a lot bigger (or smaller) than the label suggests,
that's worth flagging in the issue before you start — the label may be
wrong, or the issue may need to be split.

## Picking up an issue

Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it. If you go
quiet for a while, don't worry — someone else may pick it up, and you're
welcome to jump back in on something else.

## Code style

- `#![no_std]` throughout; no `std`-only dependencies in contract crates.
- Public functions should have doc comments explaining behavior, especially
  auth requirements and failure conditions.
- Prefer returning `Result<T, Error>` with a `#[contracterror]` enum over
  panicking, except where `require_auth()`'s own panic behavior is the
  expected failure mode.
- Keep events auditable: if a function's outcome should be visible off-chain
  (e.g. a blocked transfer), don't put it behind a code path that would
  cause the whole invocation to revert — Soroban rolls back events emitted
  during any invocation that ultimately fails.
