# Build each budgeted contract to wasm and check its binary size against
# wasm-size-budgets.toml. Run as the "wasm size budget" CI job
# (.github/workflows/ci.yml) and via `make check-wasm-size` locally.
#
# A contract's binary may grow up to 10% over its baseline before this
# fails (same tolerance convention as the per-function CPU/memory budgets
# checked by the `budget-regression` CI job / budget-baselines.toml).
#
# Contracts with no entry in wasm-size-budgets.toml are skipped with a
# warning rather than failing the build — see the comment at the top of
# that file for which contracts are currently excluded and why.
