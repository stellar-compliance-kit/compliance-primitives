# A crate that isn't a workspace member silently misses `cargo test
# --workspace`, `cargo clippy --workspace`, and the wasm-build CI job — its
# tests stop running without anyone noticing. This script catches that gap
# before it ships.

#   scripts/check-workspace-members.sh

# Exit status:
#   0 - every contracts/*/Cargo.toml and examples/*/Cargo.toml directory is
#       listed as a workspace member
#   1 - at least one is missing (the missing paths are printed)
